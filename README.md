## Preface

In the spirit of sharing on the Internet and for the convenience of students, I have created this organization to archive the slides of all the Computer Science courses.

The smooth operation of this organization needs to be maintained by everyone:family_man_woman_girl_boy:

## Join us

This project needs to be built by everyone :busts_in_silhouette:

I have set up a team dedicated to maintaining this project :wrench: . The main tasks are.

1. check the format of the uploaded files to make sure they conform to the specifications
2. organizing files (e.g. flagging courses that have been removed)
3. remove old or invalid resources
4. remove non-conforming resources
